SQL is the language used to communicate with databases. 

SQL is used to access, manipulate, and retrieve data from objects in a database. 

Databases can have one or more schemas, which provide the organization and structure and contain other objects.

Within a schema, the objects most commonly used in data analysis are tables, views, and functions.

Tables contain fields, which hold the data. 
  Tables may have one or more indexes; an index is a special kind of data structure that allows data to be retrieved more efficiently. 
  Views are essentially stored queries that can be referenced in the same way as a table. 
  Functions allow commonly used sets of calculations or procedures to be stored and easily referenced in queries.
